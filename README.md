# SimplePascalInterpreter

A C# implementation of Spivak Ruslan's "Let's Build a Simple Interpreter".
(Found here: https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)

His tutorial uses Python, but I wanted to make a C# version of it. It's probably not the best or prettiest design, but it seems to be working correctly.
