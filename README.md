# Simple Pascal Interpreter

A C# implementation of Ruslan Spivak's "Let's Build a Simple Interpreter".
Blog found here: https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/
Git code found here: https://github.com/rspivak/lsbasi

His tutorial uses Python, but I wanted to make a C# version of it.
It's probably not the best or prettiest design, but it seems to be working correctly.

# Irwin Extensions

Irwin Rodriguez continued with more features after Ruslan's first 19 parts.

* Added Irwin Part 1, string constant, string type, accidentally '+' works to concatenate
